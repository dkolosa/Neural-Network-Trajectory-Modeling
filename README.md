# Using Neural Networks to Model Orbit Rendezvous

This proposal studies the modeling of proximity maneuvers of a chaser spacecraft relative to a target using a feed-forward neural network. The orbital proximity uses the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations to model the relative position and velocity of the chaser vehicle relative to a target vehicle over a set maneuver time. Using supervised learning, a set of three neural networks are trained and tested against multiple orbit proximity maneuvers to demonstrate using neural networks for modeling orbital proximity problems
